This repository contains all 12 projects completed as part of the [**CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/) offered by Harvard University through OpenCourseWare.  
The course explores foundational concepts in Artificial Intelligence including search, knowledge representation, uncertainty, optimization, learning, and natural language processing — all implemented in Python.
